Challenge: Turn On Mobile Data (No Root, No Shizuku, Dynamic Layout - Moto Devices)

The Problem I Solved:

Can you build a system using MacroDroid that turns Mobile Data ON on a Motorola (Moto) device with no root access, no Shizuku, no external tools — and using only UI Interaction?

Sounds simple? Here’s the catch:

On Moto phones, Mobile Data is hidden inside the "Internet" panel.

The position of the toggle is dynamic. It changes based on:

How many WiFi networks are around.

whether you are connected/disconnected from wifi.

The position on toggle is never the same.

Random UI element spacing on different occasions.



Despite all this, I created a solution that:

Works 100% reliably no matter what the UI layout is.

Requires no advanced logic (no AND/OR/XOR, no loops).

Was done using MacroDroid only.

Works even if the phone is locked, with a specific SMS trigger.

Does not rely on “trial-and-error” coordinates — it has one simple key idea that makes it all stable.


I’m just someone who:

Has no coding background.

Didn’t take Maths or Computer Science in school.

Learned MacroDroid by raw experimentation, pen & paper, and testing on a single personal device.

Cracked this like a puzzle using pure logic and persistence, without even knowing what “if conditions” were in the beginning.

The Challenge for You:

Can you create a MacroDroid setup that does the same?

> Goal: Turn Mobile Data ON through UI interaction (no root, no external tools), reliably, on Moto phones, under any condition — even with dynamic layout shifts.



Post your method, your logic, or even ask questions.
Let’s see how many people can crack the code.

If this gets attention, I’ll post the actual working method — but until then, I’m holding the key concept.
